# UiPath-YourPet-Project

In this project we have used UiPath Studio inorder to create a bot that takes input of details about the user's pet and after that using gmail send them back to a 
specified mail ID.
Firstly, inorder to make this file work one would have to create new target points for all the "Click" and "Type Into" boxes as described below.

Then all that has to be done is to set up the sender's gmail in the "Use Gmail" box (All one has to do is login to their own mail ID).

This is how it would work:

Firstly, after taking input it displays what you entered it displays a text box.

After that it opens google and types in the animal type and breed and searches it up.

After all that it mails the information as well as the image to the mail ID specified at the start.
